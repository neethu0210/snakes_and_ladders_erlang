# Snakes And Ladders BFS Solver
This is an Erlang implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve the classic Snakes and Ladders problem. The goal is to determine the minimum number of dice throws required to move from the start to the finish on a game board, accounting for ladders and snakes.
